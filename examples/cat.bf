A program that is (seemingly) analogous to GNU/Linux's cat
Whatever you put in
it outputs

However it does not terminate so piping will warrant a stream of random bytes
This is a limitation within common Brainf**k where you cannot have a while block looking for negative 1 in getchar()

Notice I am not using commas as that would confuse the compiler
Brainf**k needs a comment system but it is not official so I will not implement it
